      "text": "recently visited the UCO Bank branch near Orbit Mall, Civil Lines, Jaipur, with my aunt to address a transaction issue. Unfortunately, our experience was extremely disappointing due to the unprofessional behavior of the staff.\nThe male staff were very rude and dismissive. When I asked for a solution to our issue, they replied harshly, stating, \"We can’t do anything, and you’re not even our customer.\" Such a response is unacceptable in a service-oriented environment.\n\nThe branch manager, instead of addressing our concern, was busy on a phone call, during which he used abusive language in front of us. This behavior, especially in front of women, is highly inappropriate and unprofessional.\n\nhis experience left us feeling frustrated and disrespected. I would strongly advise others to think twice before opening an account at this branch. While UCO Bank is a government bank, the lack of accountability and basic courtesy from the staff is unacceptable.\n\nI hope the bank takes steps to improve its customer service and ensure that such incidents do not happen in the future.",
