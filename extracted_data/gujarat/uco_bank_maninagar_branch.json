      "text": "Dear everyone.\nWith a very sad note I need to inform you that I was promised a home loan @ 8.3% by Mr Mayur Uco bank Maninagar, Ahmedabad branch. The loan was sanctioned on 20 Nov 24 and first amount of 13680300/- was disbursed on 26 Nov( Last date of payment to builder was 27 Nov).\nBut to utter surprise he got it sanctioned for 8.35% without any prior information to me just a day prior to builder payment. I got stuck as I had no reaction time but to agree at that point in time . The meeting was in Adani realty office( builder) and Mr Ankit uco bank area manager also present.  The customer has no option but to accept.\nKindly note that just a day prior to last date of payment to the builder, he comes out with the sanction letter of 8.35% and that too EMI for total loan amount and not what was disbursed. This was again not disclosed by him in face-to-face during first meeting with me at my home regarding loan details along with one more UCO bank representative . He promised that it was only for the sanction and will finally it will be 8.3% only. This point was time and again clarified by me from him which he always justified. But he always kept me in dark till date.\nWhat needs to be highlighted here is that this person lures the customers by false promises and puts them in a situation where there is no option I.e last date of payment of loan. This is ridiculous and he is a misfit in your organisation . He is supported by Mr Ankit, his superior , who works hand in hand by luring customers initially and later backing off.\nAlso, The EMI has been set at full loan amount but it is construction linked which was very well discussed with him. And he denies it now. I should pay EMI for the loan which has been disbursed and NOT for the total loan amount. This is illegal and I never approved it.\nThe date for EMI was discussed for 02nd\nof each month which is again not finalised and the date has surpassed. Same issue was also discussed with Mr Ankit but he is Mr friend of Mayur . Even It was brought was very categorically by me on a call with him too stating these issues created by Mr Mayur which he had agreed to rectify but backing off now. This is absolutely stupidity and calls for legal action against them.\nNevertheless, Appropriate action for mental and financial harassment is being initiated by me against both legally and will be widely circulated on social media as well to warn other customers not to fall in their trap.\nDear team, kindly take suitable and immediate action against these two people who lure the customers towards lower ROI and other related promises. And keep things pending till the last date.\nI have tried my level best to get to the correct conclusion as promised by them. Now even Mr Ankit is in denial mode. There has been no response, and they are not responding to the calls.  Kindly act pls ASAP.",
