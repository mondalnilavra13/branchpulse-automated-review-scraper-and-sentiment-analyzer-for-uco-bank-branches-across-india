Most of the people of Narasinghpur area depends on this branch like farmer, business man, govt and private offices, school and college, student etc. People face a lot of difficulties in this branch like shortage of staff, minimum space for account holders, wheel chair not accessable, not proper arrangement for old age people while withdrawing their pensions. During pension withdrawal date the pension holder get lot of difficulties and stand in queue for a long time. The bank not having parking place. The vehicle are parked in the middle of the state highway. Drinking water facility for account holder not available only for staff available. The manager is requested to look into the above matter and solve the problems so that the faith of people towards the branch maintained.",
