Not only did they fail to address my concerns properly, but the behavior of their staff was downright rough and unprofessional.\n\nI expected a certain level of respect and courtesy from a financial institution, but instead, I was met with rude and dismissive attitudes. It's disheartening to see such a lack of empathy and understanding when dealing with customers who rely on their services.\n\nI believe that a bank should prioritize customer satisfaction and should strive to provide a positive experience for their clients. Unfortunately, this bank fell short in every possible way.\n\nI hope they take this feedback seriously and make the necessary improvements to avoid driving away more customers in the future. As for now, I will be looking for an alternative institution that values its customers and treats them with the respect they deserve.",
