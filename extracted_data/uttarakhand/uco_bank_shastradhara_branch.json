But the staff is so lost that without checking they issued a new ATM card. While I tried to get details of the amount deducted from my bank account they didn't responded correctly and no information was received from their side. Such kind of attitude never expected from them. The old staff is very polite but the new one is worst. In the past few months this kind of attitude is observed regularly",
