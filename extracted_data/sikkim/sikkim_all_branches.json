When I visited the branch next day at 10:30am they said me to came after 1 pm , due to some issue I am not able to come on that day.  I visited there after two days again , then they said me that they are not responsible for online account opening and they cannot provide atm and Passbook, they suggested me to open a new account at the branch but when I asked for account opening form they again said me to come on next Monday. After this nuisance, I made a call to UCO customer care , they said to handover the call to their workers but they refused to took the call , then customer care said that go to the manager's office and give the call go him. They scolded the manager and manager was angry on workers , I got the passbook and they have applied for atm immediately.  😌",

It's disheartening to see such a lack of empathy and understanding when dealing with customers who rely on their services.\n\nI believe that a bank should prioritize customer satisfaction and should strive to provide a positive experience for their clients. Unfortunately, this bank fell short in every possible way.\n\nI hope they take this feedback seriously and make the necessary improvements to avoid driving away more customers in the future.

        "text": "A typical public sector bank. Customer preference always comes second after bank employee preference. I have had an account here since 2015. The services have improved in a major way since that time but it still lags in comparison to a private bank. The bank offers all the typical services of a public sector bank such as savings account, current account, various loans, etc. However, like almost every PSB, the process of availing those services is very lengthy and time consuming.\nFew points -\n\nStaff behaviour: The staff in 2015 was the most pathetic one I ever came across even when compared to that of SBI at that time. The deputy manager at that timewas so slow that I can figuratively compare him wiith a sloth and then too, the sloth would have won wrt the speed of doing work. However, the staff behaviour has substantially changed now-a-days and the gap has abridged compared to that of a private bank. After the staff completely changed in the branch after 2015, there had been two deputy managers since and both of them were at par in terms of dedication to their work and the quality of their work. They both complained about the immense amount of work pressure on them, but never compromised with their service quality. However, given the strict guidelines by the RBI, a strong private sector bank will always outweigh a public bank due to their focus on competitiveness and customer satisfaction. I therefore believe that if all other costs remain the same, why not choose a private bank?\n\nAccessibility: It is situated near education department's office, although, reaching here is a little bit tricky if one doesn't use Google maps. However, it is very near to the Raipur ring road.\n\nNot Disabled friendly: The office as well as the parking is not at all disabled friendly. There is no ramp available, plus the parking surface is uneven and doesn't have a separate parking space for the disabled.\n\nParking: Very small space in front of the bank is available for parking which is insufficient. Though the sidewalk tiles have been placed but the surface is uneven.\n\nAdditionally, the app of the bank is also very slow, unresponsive and it malfunctions many a times.\n\nOverall, I would not recommend anyone to open an account in UCO bank if they have an option of any other bank.",

The lunch timings are from 2-2.30pm but the bank employees don't work even after 2:30 and extend their lunch timings till 3pm.\n\nEspecially there is a lady that sits at the cashier window, she doesn't know how to talk to customers and keep saying to all - \"abhi mat aao, baad mai aana, mai abhi busy hu\". This attitude is not acceptable from any employee. I have been observing this since a long time, earlier I thought that she might be genuinely busy but her attitude never changed over the time.\n\nIt is a humble request to the UCO bank head office, to look into this and if possible change this branch employees, then only they will understand and respect their customers.",

Myself visited 3 times but still i am not able to open the account. And staff specially the ladies that sit in the left bay they speak so much rudely with the customer as if we are some  illiterate people. The service is litterally poor.

I don't know the name of the lady ( she wears glasses and little old, may be the senior bank personel)  does not have manners and doesn't know the meaning of customer delight!!! My mother wanted a new ATM card for the first time in her life as she always use to visit the bank for her banking services. She is old and not well as she is a senior citizen and cannot go to the bank for withdrawal of money , she is a customer with UCO bank for almost more then 22 years!!! The lady in the bank didn't meet my mother's expectation for the services and was rude during our interaction with her to get a new ATM card. I personaly informed this to the branch manager of the defence colony branch. After giving her the documents she asked for like adhar card, she at the end stated that a new ATM card is sent to our address after wasting our 1 hour.  but unfortunately my mother doesn't live at that address anymore, for which my mother needed a instant ATM card. This lady literally wasted our time in the bank leaving us with no solution and 100% dissatisfaction!!\nI hope she should be given some classes for the customer service and how to deal with customers!!! Very important for her personal growth!! I will tell this to my friend circle what really happened with us today visiting UCO bank, defence colony branch and will never visit this bank again !!!",

Then he got busy with his phone.\nAnother staff came and did the same above mentioned procedure.\nLastly, third staff came and spoke very rudely which made me feel of not waiting there anymore.\n\nI miss the old staff where who used to do work so quickly and above all they were so polite.",

        "text": "Dear everyone.\nWith a very sad note I need to inform you that I was promised a home loan @ 8.3% by Mr Mayur Uco bank Maninagar, Ahmedabad branch. The loan was sanctioned on 20 Nov 24 and first amount of 13680300/- was disbursed on 26 Nov( Last date of payment to builder was 27 Nov).\nBut to utter surprise he got it sanctioned for 8.35% without any prior information to me just a day prior to builder payment. I got stuck as I had no reaction time but to agree at that point in time . The meeting was in Adani realty office( builder) and Mr Ankit uco bank area manager also present.  The customer has no option but to accept.\nKindly note that just a day prior to last date of payment to the builder, he comes out with the sanction letter of 8.35% and that too EMI for total loan amount and not what was disbursed. This was again not disclosed by him in face-to-face during first meeting with me at my home regarding loan details along with one more UCO bank representative . He promised that it was only for the sanction and will finally it will be 8.3% only. This point was time and again clarified by me from him which he always justified. But he always kept me in dark till date.\nWhat needs to be highlighted here is that this person lures the customers by false promises and puts them in a situation where there is no option I.e last date of payment of loan. This is ridiculous and he is a misfit in your organisation . He is supported by Mr Ankit, his superior , who works hand in hand by luring customers initially and later backing off.\nAlso, The EMI has been set at full loan amount but it is construction linked which was very well discussed with him. And he denies it now. I should pay EMI for the loan which has been disbursed and NOT for the total loan amount. This is illegal and I never approved it.\nThe date for EMI was discussed for 02nd\nof each month which is again not finalised and the date has surpassed. Same issue was also discussed with Mr Ankit but he is Mr friend of Mayur . Even It was brought was very categorically by me on a call with him too stating these issues created by Mr Mayur which he had agreed to rectify but backing off now. This is absolutely stupidity and calls for legal action against them.\nNevertheless, Appropriate action for mental and financial harassment is being initiated by me against both legally and will be widely circulated on social media as well to warn other customers not to fall in their trap.\nDear team, kindly take suitable and immediate action against these two people who lure the customers towards lower ROI and other related promises. And keep things pending till the last date.\nI have tried my level best to get to the correct conclusion as promised by them. Now even Mr Ankit is in denial mode. There has been no response, and they are not responding to the calls.  Kindly act pls ASAP.",

The lunch timings are from 2-2.30pm but the bank employees don't work even after 2:30 and extend their lunch timings till 3pm.\n\nEspecially there is a lady that sits at the cashier window, she doesn't know how to talk to customers and keep saying to all - \"abhi mat aao, baad mai aana, mai abhi busy hu\". This attitude is not acceptable from any employee. I have been observing this since a long time, earlier I thought that she might be genuinely busy but her attitude never changed over the time.\n\nIt is a humble request to the UCO bank head office, to look into this and if possible change this branch employees, then only they will understand and respect their customers.",

Myself visited 3 times but still i am not able to open the account. And staff specially the ladies that sit in the left bay they speak so much rudely with the customer as if we are some  illiterate people. The service is litterally poor. When we go for deposit some money that lady do not have manners at all that how to ask the customer to give the notes in right manner.

I have been reaching out to them through emails regarding my queries, and despite the fact that they have seen my mails, they seem the least interested in responding or taking any action. Their customer care is no better; it's impossible to connect with a live agent or the bank itself. All I get are automated voice calls that lead nowhere.\n\nThe lack of support and responsiveness is frustrating, and it's clear that UCO Bank does not prioritize its customers' concerns. In contrast, other banks are much more helpful and attentive. I would not recommend UCO Bank to anyone.",

Only reason for my bad review is that they don't care for public convenience, I was categorically denied to exchange a washed/faded note that I got from their ATM at Saharanpur clock tower branch during my recent travel to the place. I was told that this cannot be done in another branch other than where the note was withdrawn from and I was told to go back to Saharanpur while I was in Vasundhara Ghaziabad to exchange the note. Not sure when RBI guidelines clearly says the damaged notes can be replaced at any public sector branch why did not they do it. I believe their personal convenience comes first before the public convenience.\n\nActually, I should have taken the reviews from prior visitors seriously. Looks like this is a legacy.

They lack basic banking knowledge and professionalism, making even simple tasks frustrating and time-consuming.\n\nIt’s shocking to see such actual uneducated employees handling important financial matters. Instead of helping customers, they create unnecessary confusion and delays. If you’re thinking of opening an account here, please don’t—you’ll only regret it.\n\nUCO Bank seriously needs to fire these incompetent staff members and replace them with educated, well-trained professionals who actually understand banking and customer service.

Even though the gold loan account was closed before the due date and all necessary documents submitted to get the gold, the bank manager/officials/clerks are not giving the gold and it has been more than 4 months that we have been going to the bank. The manager (Prasanna Lakshmi) is very stubborn and shameless. The bank thinks that it is doing a favour to its customers and makes them run around for even the mistakes that the bank is doing. We are fed up with this bank.",

There was no manager available, and the assistant manager’s behavior was beyond rude, as if I had come to ask for something personal instead of professional assistance.\n\nHe didn’t even show the basic courtesy to ask me to sit or listen properly to my queries. When I inquired about another officer, I saw him sitting there doing nothing, completely indifferent to my request. I ended up waiting for 20 minutes with no resolution until I had to ask again.\n\nSuch unprofessional and disrespectful behavior is unacceptable. Banks are supposed to prioritize customer service, but this branch seems to have no regard for it. I won’t be returning, and I strongly advise others to avoid this place unless they improve their staff’s attitude and service standards.\n\nLet me know if you’d like any changes!",

I took a housing loan in 2012, and while the bank promptly increases interest rates whenever the RBI does, they fail to reduce them automatically when rates go down. Getting any clarification is a hassle, as they don’t provide updates via phone or email—we have to visit the branch and wait for long hours. It’s 2025, but the bank still operates as if it’s stuck in the 1960s. A truly frustrating experience.",

Polite, smiling staff and support staff. Quick and excellent customer service. The loan rates displayed were best in the market too, as it is a Govt. of India bank. Ample parking space with a security to guide you. The branch is on the first floor of the building. On the same floor, there is a printing/photocopy shop if you have any such needs. Highly recommend this branch. I visited around 10.30 am on a weekday and there was no rush. Well done and thank you to the branch staff and management!",

Campus is a bit green and adjacent to Db mall. Staff is well cooperative and you will also not find a much rush inside the bank campus. Although there is a need of modernisation in building. Furniture can be improved. But it's ok ok. Bank has the facilities of cheque book, passbooks opening of new account and of course drawing out demand draft as well.

And when asked for the options they moved me to a table where a man took the passbook for printing and then I waited for 15 minutes standing infront of him. He was busy in his own work and ignored the passbook completely and when I reminded him He told me to wait more. One by one all people behind me in the queue went back. The man had a very bad attitude. He didn't care about the customer's time value. Then I have to visit another branch just for printing the passbook.\nOther people here are very supportive and friendly.✌️",

It is very beneficial for the people because people buy goods from here and travel by train, so it is necessary for them to have an ATM but the ATM accepts the cards of all the banks and is a major ATM which is built at a prominent place and people come and go from here. But this is a very useful ATM for the shopping people. This is made by UCO Bank. What can the head of UCO Bank say that it is an ATM of UCO Bank and due to this, the customer does not get troubled and he can withdraw as much money from here as he wants, according to the limit in his card, he can withdraw money near the station and near the market.",

They took 205 rupees in cash for that and also deducted it from the account but today is 25/04/2023, mobile number has not been updated yet. When asked to update again, they say 205 rupees again.

Specially in Jaora the staff is very nice and friendly and very amiable staff\nThey do help many customers who are not sure what to do and how to do.here they have accounts of most of the government salaried employees. It's also very trusted nationalised bank. I keep on visiting there. They have good space for bike parking and the location is also center of the city. It's very close to the court. So many people who come for court related works from near by villages can also get there bank related work. And if they want to do some shopping they can withdraw money from bank instead of carrying it from their villages.since it's in the center of City, so other shops can also be found in 2km radius from the bank.",

In vileparle branch they never asked for Ppo no but in Dombivli branch they are asking for PPO no. I have to  take mother (who has  recently gone through Catrac Operation) back home and bring the number , i got the number but clerck told it is not that which they wanted, after some that clerck gave me the proper number . Which he could had given earlier and save our time and would had avoid giving trouble to patient who has recently operated. Very bad experience i had faced today.

Firstly he shared all details for the other branch like email ID, contact details etc. Then he also understood the queries which we had with other branch and gave answers to those - like what documents needed etc etc. When we informed that other branch is not picking phone, he even helped find us the direct contact nos.\n\nFrankly this was completely unexpected from a PSU Ban employee!\n\nKudos to Mr Yadav for his passion and customer centricity.💯 🙏🤲",

I think it still operates in a outdated system and process. And it’s transaction speed uff what to say  so slow so slow  that you can’t wait. You will not understand its arrangements where to take form, where to deposit  and where is managers room. When you will visit you will get a very hectic queue, long waiting lines. And in the end electric supply was really hell. Every time the current get disconnected and the bank management doesn’t have any arrangement for current.

We have been following for last two weeks for netbanking transaction issues, cheque book reissue and MOD facility. They simply don't check any issue and just give absurd gyaan and tell to wait for another 15 days. I also observed many people facing communication issues as UCO Bank has posted Non-odia staffs. They are not suitable to handle a rural banking branch. There is no  token system or no special queue for senior citizens. I don't recommend banking with this branch at all.",

Branch expansion started at a fast pace, particularly in rural areas, and the bank achieved several unique distinctions in Priority Sector lending and other social uplift activities. To keep pace with the developing scenario and expansion of business, the Bank undertook an exercise in organisational restructuring in the year 1972. This resulted in more functional specialisation, decentralisation of administration and emphasis on development of personnel skill and attitude. Side by side, whole hearted commitment into the government's poverty alleviation programmes continued and the convenorship of State Level Bankers' Committee (SLBC) was entrusted on the Bank for Odisha and Himachal Pradesh in 1983.total numbers of branch more than 4,000.\nThe logo of UCO bank consists of a pair of clasped hands covered with an octagonal structure. It has been coloured blue since the organisation's inception, blue representing the Bank's national responsibility. The background has remained yellow since the beginning as well.",

Please cross check the cctv cameras and i request higher authority please arrange a security incharge here and check the belongings of staff before going back to home. All the staff members are not good in work they didnt care about customers as well and dnt habe manners how to talk with customers. They show their rude and educated behaviour with their customers.

        "text": "The staff is very rude and mannerless, especially the lady that sits on the second counter. Her name is Anuradha.\nThis bank majorly works with aged people as whenever I visit, I always see elderly people visiting regarding pensions and other stuff. The lady doesn't know how to speak to them, she's rude, always in attitude and talks as if she's doing a favour.\nThe people who visit here are mostly uneducated or less educated, so it's the responsibility of the staff to tell them politely. Once a lady said \"hum bohot dur se aate hai\" to which the bank lady on the second counter (Anuradha) replied \"arey toh isme hum kya kare yeh apki kami hai, hum thodi bolte hai aane ko\".\nRemember Ms. anuradha, you are being paid and not paying your customers. Have some shame.",

Unfortunately, our experience was extremely disappointing due to the unprofessional behavior of the staff.\nThe male staff were very rude and dismissive. When I asked for a solution to our issue, they replied harshly, stating, \"We can’t do anything, and you’re not even our customer.\" Such a response is unacceptable in a service-oriented environment.\n\nThe branch manager, instead of addressing our concern, was busy on a phone call, during which he used abusive language in front of us. This behavior, especially in front of women, is highly inappropriate and unprofessional.\n\nhis experience left us feeling frustrated and disrespected. I would strongly advise others to think twice before opening an account at this branch. While UCO Bank is a government bank, the lack of accountability and basic courtesy from the staff is unacceptable.\n\nI hope the bank takes steps to improve its customer service and ensure that such incidents do not happen in the future.",
