I am in Bathinda and the local branch here is asking me to visit Ropar branch for closure of my account. In today's era, when everything is digital and a lot more services are available online now, this bank seems to be working in an old fashioned way. Why would someone open an account with these so called nationalised banks when they are virtually operating locally.",
