      "text": "A typical bank with long lunch hours, obviously a money transactions and all the things can be done here and the ATM is well located outside the campus on the main road. This bank is located inside the board office campus only. Ask the guard Shiva inside the campus to locate the bank , parking is free water and bathroom facilities are available. Campus is a bit green and adjacent to Db mall. Staff is well cooperative and you will also not find a much rush inside the bank campus. Although there is a need of modernisation in building. Furniture can be improved. But it's ok ok. Bank has the facilities of cheque book, passbooks opening of new account and of course drawing out demand draft as well. Recommended if you are a UCO Bank customer. I like the parking thing a lot.",
