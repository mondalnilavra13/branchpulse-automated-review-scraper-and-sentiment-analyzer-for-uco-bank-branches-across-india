      "text": "Worst Bank Everr!\nIt is very disappointing & disheartened experience with your bank this time.  All work is been delayed , even consulting from March 23, 2024. Because of this delay my daughter’s future and received opportunity is at stake. It is worse experience of my life and all the delay because of your authorities the future of student with ability is at high risk. Still today we are in rushing in other bank and still waiting. Even handing over the cheque your bank took 15 days to hand over legal papers of the property even an assurance was given of 2 days. Convey my feedback to concern authorities about the long delay and  disappointment as client. Lots of disappointment and delayed services.\nVery bad service. Never going to this stupid bank.",
