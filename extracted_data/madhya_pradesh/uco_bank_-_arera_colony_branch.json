And when asked for the options they moved me to a table where a man took the passbook for printing and then I waited for 15 minutes standing infront of him. He was busy in his own work and ignored the passbook completely and when I reminded him He told me to wait more. One by one all people behind me in the queue went back. The man had a very bad attitude. He didn't care about the customer's time value. Then I have to visit another branch just for printing the passbook.\nOther people here are very supportive and friendly.‚úåÔ∏è",
